## About The Research

![Product Name Screen Shot](image/flowchart.png)
This is a screenshot of our research result

<br><br>

This research study the effective methods that novice data scientists can adopt to enhance their
understanding of pre-written data analytical programs. We conducted user studies with five novice data
scientists and four expert data scientists. In each study, participants were presented with a pre-written
data analytical program and asked to use think-aloud method to explain their thought processes.
Based on their responses, we performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses. <ins>The materials in this 
repository include the pre-written code we asked our participants to analyze</ins>.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## User Study Protocol

### Files Descriptions
* **buoy.txt**: dataset that the program interact with

* **data_analytical_problem.ipynb**: pre-written data analytical program

* **saver_func.py**: helper function that download the entire dataframe visualize
every entry in html

### Set Up
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dstl-lab/Code-Comprehension-User-Study.git
   ```
3. Install environment using conda
   ```sh
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```

### Procedure
| Task                     | Time | Time out of 60 | Description                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intro                    | 5    | 5              | Open `data_analytical_problem.ipynb` and introduce the scenario.                                          |
| Task 0 & Task 1          | 10   | 5 - 15        | Participants spent 10 minutes on understanding Task 0 and Task 1.                                         |
| Rating & Follow-up 1     | 5    | 15 - 20             | Participants rated the difficulties and answered follow-up questions for Task 0 and Task 1.               |
| Task 2                   | 10   | 20 - 30             | Participants spent 10 minutes on understanding Task 2.                                                    |
| Rating & Follow-up 2     | 5    | 30 - 35             | Participants rated the difficulties and answered follow-up questions for Task 2.                          |
| Task 3                   | 10   | 35 - 45             | Participants spent 10 minutes on understanding Task 3.                                                    |
| Rating & Follow-up 3     | 5    | 45 - 50             | Participants rated the difficulties and answered follow-up questions for Task 3.                          |
| Interview                | 10    | 50 - 60             | Concluding interview to gather additional comments and feedback.                                          |
### Notebook Details
Regardless of their level of expertise, participants were represented with the same notebook. Each task in the notebook represents a different stage of the data analytical pipeline: Task 0 represents data cleaning; Task 1 represents missing value assessment; Task 3 represents data imputation; and Task 4 represents evaluating the imputation results.

### Interview Questions

Participants were asked the following questions during the interview phase of the study (due to time constrain, part of the questions were being asked):
- What information are you trying to gather that you couldn’t from just the default Pandas output?
- Which rows and columns would you add to the smaller table in order to not need to refer to the larger table? (pick as many as you see fit)
- What are you thinking about here? What additional information would make this immediate problem easier to solve?
- What did you find easy or difficult about this task?
- What did you find to be the most effective way to understand the code?
- When you looked broadly at the full table from the save() function, how did you know what to look for?
- Let’s look at two of your HTML tables. How did you know what to look at on these tables specifically?
- Do you have any feedback, comments, or questions?

### Participant Responses
After each task, participants were asked to complete a survey describing their feelings on the task in Google form ([Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTyCIK46--Dc7BeiipfQY2fdwvYzYv9q2C_kHfvHpTVPr01w/viewform?usp=sf_link)). We also asked for two synonymous data scientists to evaulate participants' response based on the [rubric](./study_data/Code_Comprehension_Grading_Rubric.pdf) we proved.
